        <p>
          A Brand Identity for Afford India, a homegrown brand, is poised to carve a niche in the
          burgeoning market for handcrafted goods by offering a curated selection of silver
          jewellery, brass, and wooden home decor. This brand identity proposal aims to create a
          compelling narrative that resonates with the modern Indian consumer, blending traditional
          artistry with contemporary aesthetics. The core philosophy is to redefine “affordability”
          not as being inexpensive, but as the accessible indulgence in quality, and handcrafted
          luxury.
